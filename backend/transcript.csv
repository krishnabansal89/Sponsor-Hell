Paid social media trends, paid posts, paid paparazzi, paid podcasts, these are used to create a hype for films. The box office collections you are told about, contain many lies and frauds.",Normal
0:30,"Hello friends! Have you ever noticed that these Bollywood actors and celebrities whenever and wherever they go, a crowd of paparazzi always follows them with their cameras in their hands. Whether they are going to the airport at 11 PM to catch a flight or whether they leave the gym in the afternoon after a work out session. Someone or the other is always there to click their photos.",Normal
1:00,"If they go to a market to shop, coincidently, the paparazzi follow them there too. And if they start travelling in an auto rickshaw instead of a car for some reason, it becomes a news headline. It's quite strange. I travel in Delhi metro and auto rickshaws too, but no newspaper has ever printed such a headline for me. And neither have I ever seen a paparazzi in my life. But it's not just about me. You won't see this happening for most YouTubers.",Normal
1:30,"And there are some immensely popular Bollywood actors with whom this rarely happens. What a coincidence! On the other hand, some relatively unknown people's faces are shown to us repeatedly by the paparazzi. On social media and in newspapers. To the extent where this makes them famous. Or, it'd be better to say that they are turned famous.",Normal
2:00,"Friends, in this video, let's understand this glamourous world of celebrities, how real it is, and how fake. Today, the word 'Paparazzi' is used for those people whose job is to click photos of celebrities and high-profile people. In India, they are these people. 'Paparazzi' is a plural word. The singular form is 'Paparazzo.' And it's quite interesting to know how it originated.",Normal
2:30,"In 1960, an Italian film was released called La Dolce Vita. A side character in this film was called Paparazzo. He was an annoying but fearless reporter who was ready to go to any extent to click photos of celebrities. The film's director revealed in his autobiography the reason he chose the word 'Paparazzo.' Because it is an Italian slang which refers to a big, annoying mosquito. He said that this was the right word to depict the reporter's personality.",Normal
3:00,"Just like a mosquito flies around your ears, biting you and annoying you, the news reporter was like that.",Normal
3:15,"'What happened in the meeting between you and Nitish?' 'How was the meeting?' 'This is not the right place to talk. Let's not disturb them.' 'How was the meeting between you and Nitish?' 'I don't have to comment on anything.' 'Why? Was the meeting nice?' 'Did you get Nitish Kumar's blessings? Is he okay? Is he happy?' 'Why is this not the right time to talk?' 'When you speak to someone... Tell us everything is fine, that's all.'",Normal

5:30,"In 1961, in the Time magazine, a feature article was written on paparazzi, which made the word 'Paparazzi' even more popular. In that article, the paparazzi were called a pack of hungry wolves. There was a simple reason behind this. In those days, this was what the paparazzi culture was known for. Secretly taking photos of celebrities without their permission, without caring for their privacy. Following celebrities everywhere to get photos.",Normal
6:00,"In 1997, the infamous car accident of Princess Diana in which she passed away, the news was spread all over the world. A big reason for this was revealed to be the paparazzi. That night, the paparazzi's cars were shamelessly following her car. In order to escape them, the driver sped up the car and this led to the car crashing into a pillar while entering the tunnel. Due to this single incident, the world started questioning the ethical boundaries of the paparazzi.",Normal
6:30,"But in India, during the 1990s, the paparazzi culture was just beginning. After the economic liberalisation of 1991, along with international brands, tabloid culture came to India. Magazines like Stardust, Midday, Bombay Times, and Page 3 started becoming popular. Yogen Shah is known as India's first paparazzo and back when there was no internet and social media the business model of these paparazzi was very simple. Take candid photos of popular celebrities that no one has seen before.",Normal
7:00,"And sell these photos to magazines and tabloids. People were very interested in this because in the absence of social media there were not many chances to get a glimpse of celebrities' lives. The general public was curious to know. How did these celebrities live their lives? How do their homes look? What do they do in their personal time? This is why this culture became popular.",Normal
7:30,"But today, after the advent of social media, the whole system has turned upside down. Now, for the paparazzi, directly taking money from celebrities to click their 'candid' photos has become a new model. I am not kidding, many paparazzi openly admit this. 'Smaller stars do call you, right?' 'See smaller stars... They send messages on media groups.' 'They're even ready to pay and they request us to shoot their pics.' 'Give us some names.' 'Everybody who's new. Even everybody who's made it also, will always start off, right?' 'The paparazzi thing is commercialised now. In a very big way.'",Normal
8:00,"Now, two different types of models have evolved here. One, the so-called celebrities who want publicity and pay paparazzi for their PR and publicity. And the second is the top A-list real celebrities who don't need publicity. Who would never want to pay for to have their photos taken, but the public would still want to see their photos to see their private candid photos, so the paparazzi secretly click their photos.",Normal
8:30,"In the second category, there are people like Shahrukh Khan, Aamir Khan, and Virat Kohli. But the question here is, the numerous photos of celebrities you see or social media and in newspapers, how many are authentic? And how many are paid PR photos? In an interview, Manav Manglani said that this ratio is around 30:70. But in my opinion, the ratio is actually 90:10. 90% of the things you see on social media, on TV, or in newspapers, about these celebrities, are paid promotions, and fake acting. And only 10% are authentic.",Normal
9:00,"Why am I saying this? You'll understand this later in the video. Think about it, in a celebrity's life, how many things that you see publicly are paid promotion PR? And how many are authentic and real? Secondly, notice when these celebrities appear on podcasts and interviews. 90% of celebrities appear on podcasts only when their movies are about to be released.",Normal
9:30,"And if we talk about those social media pages that regularly post about Bollywood and celebrities, it can be quite difficult for you to identify this there. But many of the posts are often PR and paid promotion. Sometimes, you can see clear proof of this. For example, on the Instagram page 'Instant Bollywood', look at this 2 year old post. What is its caption?",Normal
10:00,"'Hi, can you please use this picture and mention #DivyaKhoslaKumar? This is BTS of her recently released song #Designer.' The caption that the celebrity asked them to write, was mistakenly copy-pasted here. Although, this post was later corrected. But this should tell you that most of the posts you see on social media, on such accounts, are PR.",Normal
10:30,"How many times does it happen that the caption of such posts is 'What are your thoughts on this?' Or 'What is your opinion on this?' This too is a trick to ensure more engagement. Now, since you know the paparazzi and PR industry better, let's talk about Box Office.",Normal
11:00,"It's quite normal to hear that a film's box office collection has crossed ₹100 crores or ₹200 crores. It seems so often that this might be the new normal. In reality, all the actors have become ₹100 crore actors and the film industry is flourishing. But the truth is the opposite. And I'm not saying this, but so many senior trade analysts like Komal Nahata and Taran Adarsh have openly talked about this.",Normal
11:30,"In reality, most of the numbers that are told to you about Box Office are manipulated. The real numbers are inflated by 40%-50%. For example, the movie Selfiee starring Akshay Kumar and Emraan Hashmi. The official figures showed that the film had a Box Office collection of around ₹14 crores in its opening weekend. But an article of BollyMojo has claimed that the real Box Office collection of the film was around ₹8 crores. If the Box Office collections were reported to be almost double of the actual figures for this film, how can you believe the figures of other films?",Normal
12:00,"The people who provide real figures for the Box Office collections, in return, they get money from the producers. The money comes from production houses to media houses and from media houses to entertainment journalists. And journalists like Komal Nahata do not hide this. They claim that there's nothing wrong in this, because this is marketing of films. Because when a high number is reported, the film seems to be a hit, and this leads to more collections.",Normal
12:30,"Just think, you are constantly lied to about so many things. Not only Box Office collections, you can see lies in every industry. From food industry to health and beauty industry, we can see lies being told everywhere. Marketing and advertisement industry works in a very dirty way.",Normal
13:00,"They sell things with lies, and make money out of it. And people who work in this industry, work in a way that even the common people start believing in their lies. So, don't blindly believe anything you see on social media, or TV, or in newspapers. Always cross-check whatever you see or read.",Normal

0:00,"28 June 2024 45 year old Ramesh Kumar went to Delhi Airport to drop his customer. He is working overtime because he wants to collect money for his elder daughter's wedding. As soon as he drops the customer, he is working in Delhi. The roof of Terminal 1 of the airport falls on his car and he dies there. Big news is coming from Delhi where a big accident has happened at Terminal 1 of Delhi Airport where a part of the terminal suddenly collapsed one day. First, on June 27, 2024, the roof of the recently inaugurated airport of Jabalpur collapses; on July 1, two people were murdered; in Mathura, when a 2.5 lakh liter water tank collapsed; and the condition of Ayodhya is such that even today one is speaking. Is Ayodhya trusting Ram? Is Ayodhya now trusting Ram? The reason for this question is the pictures coming from Ayodhya after some rain, whereas the drains of Gurgaon have become fountains but all the records have been broken. In Bihar, seven bridges have collapsed in the last 15 days. Life is so cheap in India that as soon as you step out of the house, either a hoarding will fall on you or the roof of the airport or a bridge will slip from your feet. According to government data, 8500 people will die between 2018 and 2022. This happened because the public infrastructure has collapsed. So who is responsible? Why is India's infrastructure so bad?",Normal
1:00,"This is Bilal, a school teacher in Jammu, and my team spoke to him to understand how he got from here to here. Bilal told us that he had the problem of hair fall for a long time but instead of being demotivated, he tried to find a solution and Bilal is not alone. The problem of hair fall is happening in many Indian men due to which many people are now going for hair transplant. Many people who are undergoing surgeries think that once hair loss starts, it cannot be stopped, but Bilal completely changed his situation in five-six months. With the help of Tria, in Bilal's case, he got relief from hair loss as well. There were also problems with gut health and digestion, but before starting Troya's plan, he did not know that there was a relationship between all these things. After talking to Troya's team, it came to know that the reason behind hair loss is metabolism, energy, hormones, genes, sleep and There are many reasons like stress, now many people do not treat these problems side by side due to which their hair loss problem does not stop whereas Tria gives you an all-round solution, they provide dermatologist approved serum along with vitamins and minerals. They also prepare a diet plan and due to this, Bilal's hair loss problem stopped in five months.

If you use the code then let's come back to the video.",Sponsored
2:00,"Now why is the infrastructure so bad in our country? For that we have to understand what is the process of an infrastructure project. First a contract is given to the company and then that company designs and executes the project. After which we have to maintain that infrastructure for which we have to get safety audits done but in India the problem starts in the contract stage. Its main root is that our government uses A1 contracts. Now what is A1 contracts? I will tell you. Let me explain with an example: On March 31, 2016, around 12:30 pm, there was a huge crowd on Vivekananda Road near Girish Park Metro Station in Kolkata. Many people were going to office while others were going on lunch break and at the same time Vivekananda Flyover. An under construction part of a flyover falls on people and 26 people are crushed to death.",Normal
3:00,"IVRCL? AG K Murthy, the operations director of the company that built the flyover, said that this happened because of God but not because of God. This happened because they had submitted the lowest bid to win the contract 7 years ago. I Kharakpur also said in its report that the company tried to save cost at every level due to which the flyover collapsed but this was not an isolated incident. No, on October 30, 2022, the Morbi Bridge in Gujarat had collapsed, due to which 140 people were killed. A major accident took place on Sunday evening in Morbi, Gujarat due to the collapse of the cable bridge over the Machchu River. During this incident, a major accident occurred on the bridge. Many people standing there have fallen into the river and the Gujarat government had given the contract to repair that 100 year old suspension bridge to a local company Reva, but the main business of Reva was to make watches and lighting. The renovation contract was given to A Company That Makes Clocks Calculators Not Constructions and Certainly Not Bridges There was no evidence that this company had experience in bridge repair and this is a systemic problem in our country because our government uses A1 method to award contracts A1 method is the lowest cost method, that is, whoever works at the lowest cost in bidding is given the contract.",Normal
4:00,"It does not matter what the experience or quality of the contractor is. In fact, a report by the Indian government itself has shown that this thing Many projects fail because of this. In 2002, the Central Vigilance Commission, a government body, had also said in its report that many contracts are given to companies which do not have any qualification and this is due to the Elve method. Because what many companies do is that in order to win a contract, they make a fake budget, they deliberately show very low cost, if they show low cost for everything, then they will win the contract and this is what happens, now it is not so. The government is not trying to change this. On October 29th 2021, the Finance Ministry made new guidelines for contracts where they said that now the quality of the contractor will also be checked before giving them the contract. This system was called based on quality less cost base selection. In the press release, the ministry also said that this system will not replace our traditional ALV system but it will be used only in a few cases, like in 2021, the government had said that this new system will be used only for those contracts whose value is ₹ crore.",Normal
5:00,"Now after 2 years, this change was definitely done but still the government did not say that the new system will be implemented in every project, that is why even today A1 system is mostly used for developing infrastructure, then in this new system. Also, every criterion of the contractor is not evaluated but this is not logical. Think for yourself whether a government minister to build his house goes to the contractor who is the cheapest or to the one who has good quality and budget. Yes, now if our ministers use this thing for their house, then shouldn't the same logic be used for the infrastructure of our country which is used by lakhs of people but the government is not doing this to save money in the short term and in the long term? In the term, we are compromising the lives of the countrymen. Now the solution is very simple. The solution about which many researchers have written is Multi Criteria Contractor Selection Framework where many things of a contractor will be evaluated, be it bid price of financial capabilities or technical capability. Be it experience, performance or health safety, India will not be the first country to implement this system. The same system is implemented in the US and Europe, but the problem is that taking bribe in this system becomes very difficult even once the contract is awarded.",Normal
6:00,"Then again the company makes mistakes that they do not design the infrastructure properly, like look at this thing, Prime Minister Modi had inaugurated this Pragati Maidan Corridor project in June 2022, its cost was Rs 777 crore. The Prime Minister said that it is a wonderful tunnel in such a short time. It was not at all easy to prepare this integrated transit corridor in such a short time, but what happened after two years, this tunnel became useless. You see the condition of Pragati Maidan Tunnel. This integrated transit corridor was ready in such a short time. It was not at all easy to do, in fact, during last year's monsoon season, this entire project was non-operational for the general public because water was stuck here, so a project was built by spending Rs 800 crore and it became useless in 2 years. Now it is said that It was said that advanced facilities are being used in this tunnel like automated drainage. Public Works Department said that there were many technical and design mistakes in this project. Many problems were found in drainage of cracks and seepage of water. Archit Pratap Singh who is an urban planning expert.",Normal
7:00,"He is an expert and said that to make a good underground tunnel, you have to look at the conditions of soil and rock properly, but this did not happen in this Pragati Maidan tunnel due to which the water proofing was very useless. The problem of water seepage is in Bihar. The bridges seen in Bihar seem to be disintegrating like leaves. Monsoon has reached Bihar only two weeks ago, but more than water, bridges are seen falling here. See, the bridge across our Janata Bazar river has collapsed. Now, every day some bridge or the other is collapsing. The news is coming out that seven bridges have collapsed in just 13 days",Normal
8:00,"[Music] Seven bridges have collapsed in 13 days and these bridges were made under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's scheme and most of the construction companies in these projects were awarded the contract by the L1 method only. Some of the bridges which were to be inaugurated within 6 months were also inaugurated. How will they last? Even more surprising is that the media has shown the news of bridge collapse many times but even after that the administration has not started any investigation. You see the Bihar State Bridge Construction Corporation Limited whose job it is to maintain the bridges, the biggest problem is here. Because the media is not allowed to ask questions about the accountability of the government and the administration is also not taking any steps, just imagine what would happen to us if a bridge collapses on us while we are driving our car or a roof falls on us while we are waiting at the airport",Normal
9:00,"Big question is why doesn't the government do anything. So, now we understand what should the government do and what should we do. On 14 February 1990 in Surat city, 39 people died due to collapse of a building and then 22 years later, in 2012, a bridge collapsed in the same city, killing 23 people. In 2021, a 4-storey building collapsed. There are many reasons like illegal construction and poor quality materials and no safety audits. The reason is that infrastructure projects like these are completed on paper and in reality, poor materials are used. What do the people in power say, they use weak cement and iron rods of poor quality due to which these bridges do not last for long. Dr. Sudhir Kumar, who is an assistant professor at Patna University, said that there is a need for political will to change this. If the government does not hold such companies accountable then the quality of our infrastructure will never improve and all this will continue. Infrastructure projects require technical expertise and a long term vision and if you need help you should ask for help but the contractor should not compromise on the quality of materials.",Normal
10:00,"And now I will ask you one last question, do you think that the government should evaluate the quality of the contractor before giving the contract or should the contract be awarded only on the basis of cost? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",Normal

Who expected whom and if we tell you the truth, we were looking for some fight or the other, so we were going to take it, we needed kills because brother, if you play the whole time for 15-20 minutes, you will not get kills and the position is also not by chance.
